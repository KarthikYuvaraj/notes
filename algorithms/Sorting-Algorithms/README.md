# Sorting Algorithms

Sorting is arranging the elements in a list or collection in increasing or decreasing order of some property.

The Array must contain objects of the same type.

## Sorting Algorithms
- [Bubble sort][2]
- [Selection sort][1]
- [Insertion sort][3]
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Heap sort
- Counting sort
- Radix sort

## Classification

Sorting algorithms can be classified by:

1. Time complexity
2. Space Complexity or Memory Usage
3. Stability (an ability of the algorithm to preserve original order of elements of the same property)
4. Internal sort (in RAM) vs External sort (on hard disk)
5. Recursive or Non-recursive

# How To Develop A Class in Java

1. Figure out what the class is supposed to do.
2. List the instance variables and methods.
3. Write prepcode for the methods. (helps you focus on the logic without stressing about syntax)
4. Write test code for the methods. (a class or methods that will test the real code and validate that it's doing right thing; the concept of writing the test code is one of the practices of Extreme Programming (XP))
5. Implement the class. (real code)
6. Test the methods.
7. Debug and reimplement as needed.
8. Testing the live version

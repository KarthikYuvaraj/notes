# jQuery (draft, work in progress)

`.html()` lets you add HTMLtags and text within an element. Any content previously stored within the element will be completely replaced with the text you provide using this function
 
```js
// rewrites and adds <i> tag to <h3>
$('h3').html('<i>jQuery Playground</i>'); 
```

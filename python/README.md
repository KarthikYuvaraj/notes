All things related to Python, my experiments and code snippets

## Code examples in this repository include:

* object-oriented programming
    - `DogClass.py` shows as a very basic example of a Constractor, Accessor and Mutator methods, as well as Operator Overloading
* real world examples
    - **Graphite Metric Reporting Script** uses [Graphite Render API] to report via email the current state of monitored system; it utilizes the code from the following modules: `urllib`, `json`, `time`, `datetime`, `pytz`, `smtplib`, `email`
* `ReadingSingleLineformFilePattern.py` shows how to read one line of a text file using `for` loop
* `ReadMultipleLinesfromFile.py` shows how to read multiple lines of a text file using `while` loop
* `AccumulatorPattern.py` shows an Accumulator Pattern in action
* [ParsingArgumentsFromCommandLine.py] is an example of how to pass your own arguments to your scripts using `argparse`
* [BannerGrabbing.py] is a simple example of how to get an information about a remote host's webserver using `socket` and `re` modules
* [NetworkServerWithSocket.py] - basic example of a network server created with `socket`
* [UsingSSLwithSocket.py] - how to use SSL with `socket`
* [SendingEmailsUsingSMTP.py] - sending email messages using SMTP protocol with `smtplib`
